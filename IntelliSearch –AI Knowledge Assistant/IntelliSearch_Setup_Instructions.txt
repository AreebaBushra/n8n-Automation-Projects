# ⚙️ Setup Instructions 

## 1. Import Workflow into n8n
- Open your **n8n dashboard**.
- Click **Import → From File** and select the provided workflow file (`My workflow 2.json`).
- Once imported, review all nodes to confirm connections.

## 2. Configure API Credentials
- In **n8n → Credentials**, set up the following:
  - **Google Gemini AI** (for AI processing)
  - **Supabase** (for Vector Database connection)
  - **Google Drive** (for document access)

## 3. Activate Webhook Trigger
- Open the **Webhook node** in your workflow.
- Copy the webhook URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5678/webhook/your-id`) — you’ll use this in your website chatbot JavaScript file.
- Set the HTTP method to **POST**.
- Save and activate the workflow.

## 4. Update Chatbot Script
- Open your website chatbot HTML file.
- Replace the webhook URL inside the `fetch()` function with your actual n8n webhook endpoint.
- Example:
  ```js
  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5678/webhook/your-id', { ... })
  ```

## 5. Run the System
- Open your chatbot webpage in a browser.
- Type a question related to your documents.
- n8n will send it to Gemini AI → retrieve relevant info from Supabase → and return an instant, well-formatted answer.

## 6. Optional (for deployment)
- Use a service like **n8n Cloud**, **Render**, or **Railway** to host your n8n workflow online.
- Update your chatbot’s webhook URL accordingly.
