# ⚡ AI-Powered Energy Theft Detection & Grid Anomaly Alert System

AI-Powered Energy Theft Detection & Grid Anomaly Alert System is an intelligent automation workflow built with n8n, designed to identify irregular electricity consumption patterns, detect potential theft, and alert utility teams in real time.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This system automates the detection of irregular energy usage by combining:

* **AI analysis** of consumption trends
* **Automated alerts** via Gmail
* **Data tracking** through Airtable
* **Seamless integration** with Google Sheets or APIs

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
⚙️ Key Features

* Fetches and merges **current + historical meter readings**
* Uses **AI anomaly detection** (OpenAI + LangChain)
* Identifies theft, faulty meters, or billing errors
* Sends instant **email alerts** to engineers or Energy department
* Logs all detections in Airtable for tracking

## 🧠 Workflow Summary

1. Collect data from Google Sheets or APIs
2. Compare with historical usage trends
3. AI Agent evaluates consumption patterns, detects irregularities (spikes, drops, or mismatches), and classifies anomalies
4. Results (confidence, loss %, reason, and recommendations) are stored in Airtable for recordkeeping.
5. If an anomaly is detected, an automated email alert is sent to the assigned engineer with all key details and recommended next steps
