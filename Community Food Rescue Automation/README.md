# ♻️ Community Food Rescue Automation

**Community Food Rescue Automation** is a smart workflow built in **n8n** that automatically connects **food donors** with **nearby volunteers** or **NGOs** in real time via **WhatsApp**.
The system reduces food waste and promotes community-driven sustainability by automating donation coordination and delivery.

---

## 📖 Overview

Every day, restaurants, canteens, and bakeries discard edible surplus food due to the lack of a coordinated donation system.
This project automates that process using **AI**, **automation**, and **real-time communication**.

When a donor sends a WhatsApp message about available food, the system:

1. Parses the message using **Google Gemini AI** to extract donation details.
2. Identifies the **pickup location** and matches it with **volunteers in the same city**.
3. Notifies eligible volunteers via WhatsApp.
4. Sends a confirmation to the donor once a volunteer accepts the task.

This creates an **end-to-end automated food rescue chain** that saves time and reduces waste.
